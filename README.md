# Connect-4-AI-agent
This project aimed to develop a competitive AI agent for Connect 4, exploring and implementing several AI techniques. 
We implemented a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, enhancing its performance through memory caching and neural network-based move biasing. Both Fully Connected (FCNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) were trained and integrated with the MCTS agent. Performance evaluation was conducted against baseline agents and through self-play.
